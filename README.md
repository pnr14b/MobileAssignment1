# MobileAssignment1

A mobile app designed to pull the twenty most recently played songs from a user's Spotify account. 


## Requirements to download and run code:

+ You will need a Spotify account. An account is free to sign up for and to listen to music.
+ There is an included **SpotifyTest.apk** file which can be downloaded onto an Android device to see the finished project.
+ The code can be cloned into an Android Studio project and run through that method. However, due to requirements of the Spotify Web API, the SHA-1 associated with the computer which is building the file will need to updated into the Spotify Developer Dashboard. 
  + If you want to build the project on your own version of Android Studio without errors, you can email whudson9@gatech.edu with the SHA-1 and Android Package name.
